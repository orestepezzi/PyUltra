# PyUltra
PyUltra is a Python package that includes routines to investigate energy conversion and dissipation in nearly reversible space plasmas, with the possibility of exploiting both in situ observations and numerical simulations.

It was developed within the PRIN 2022 project "The ULtimate fate of TuRbulence from space to laboratory plAsmas (ULTRA)" (2022KL38BK), which was funded by the Italian Minister of University and Research and whose PI is Dr. O. Pezzi. These scientific topics have also been discussed within the International Team "Unveiling Energy Conversion and Dissipation in Non-Equilibrium Space Plasmas" (#23-588) at the International Space Science Institute (Bern), led by Dr. O. Pezzi and Prof. P. Cassak.
